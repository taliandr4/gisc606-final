#question 1: My dream GIS tech job would be working for the CDC as a GIS analyst/or epidemiologist. I would love to work in epidemiology to help create digestible maps and infographics that focus on disseminating health data to vulnerable populations in the United States. 

#question 2: The GIS techniques/applications that excite me the most include the possibility of using Python to automate simple tasks on ArcPro or creating maps using Python with open-source data. I will need more job experience before I can feel comfortable with my Esri-centric GIS experience over the past three years. 

#question 3: A non-GIS hobby that I want to focus on after this semester is embroidery. I know basic stitches and flowers, but I want to start embroidering all of my denim clothing.
